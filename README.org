All(almost all the vimgolf challenges in one org file)

This all the vim golf challenges that are scraped from [[vimgolf.com][vimgolf.com]].
I scraped and put them in a single org file because I am used to the format. I think
the challanges are good for any one working with any editor.

NB. the additional line break at the bottom of the End File section are accidental I hope to
correct it in the future.
